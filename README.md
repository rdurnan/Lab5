Ryan Durnan Lab5 Submission

This lab explored the use of stacks, vectors, and lists from the STL. 
I created a series of functions that returns input strings in reverse order. 
Additionally, I created my own class- called MyStack- that operates in 
the a similar manner to stacks. MyStack is utilized in the 4th reversal function.
